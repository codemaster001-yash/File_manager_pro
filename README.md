DocuHub PRO: Your Personal Document Command Center ðŸ“‚âœ¨
Welcome to DocuHub PRO, a sleek and intuitive front-end application designed to revolutionize how you interact with your document repositories! Whether you're wrangling local files or dreaming of seamless cloud integration (with a backend, of course ðŸ˜‰), DocuHub PRO is here to make your document management a breeze.

What is DocuHub PRO?
DocuHub PRO is a SharePoint-inspired document management interface built with a focus on user experience. It provides a clean, fast, and responsive way to browse, search, and manage your documents and folders. Think of it as your personal librarian for all your digital assets!

Key Features:
Intuitive Navigation: Easily browse through your "root" directory or dive into specific folders.

Quick Access Filters: Jump straight to "All Documents" or your "Favorites" with a single click.

Dynamic Content Display: Documents and folders are presented as visually appealing cards, complete with icons, names, sizes, and descriptions.

Search Functionality: A prominent search bar allows you to quickly find what you're looking for within your loaded data.

Local & Cloud Ready:

Local JSON File Support: Load your document structure from a data.json file for quick local testing and demos.

SharePoint/Google Drive Integration (Conceptual): The UI is ready for integration with cloud services via an API endpoint. (Note: Direct browser-based fetching from cloud services is limited by CORS, a backend is typically required for full functionality).

Personalization & Persistence:

Favorites: Mark your most important documents and folders for easy access.

Renaming: Give your files and folders custom names that persist locally.

LLM Integration (Optional): Future-proofed with optional fields for connecting to Large Language Models (LLM) for advanced document intelligence.

Responsive Design: Works beautifully across various screen sizes, from desktops to tablets.

Modern UI: Built with a clean, modern aesthetic using Font Awesome for icons and Google Fonts for typography.

Getting Started
DocuHub PRO is a client-side application. To get it up and running, all you need is a web browser!

Save the File: Save the provided gemini_docmanage_new.html file to your local computer.

Open in Browser: Simply open the gemini_docmanage_new.html file with your preferred web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).

Configuring Your Document Source
Upon first launch, or if no data is loaded, you'll see an "Empty State" prompting you to configure your source.

Click the "Settings" button in the header (or "Configure Source" in the empty state).

In the "Settings" modal:

Repository Type: Select "Local JSON File" to load data from your computer.

Select data.json File: Click "Choose File" and select a JSON file containing your document structure.

Don't have one? Create a simple data.json file like this (replace with your actual data):

JSON

[
  { "id": "f1", "name": "My Projects", "type": "folder", "children": [
    { "id": "d1", "name": "Project Alpha Brief", "type": "document", "fileType": "pdf", "size": "1.2MB", "description": "Initial project brief for Alpha.", "status": "Final", "url": "#" }
  ]},
  { "id": "d2", "name": "Team Handbook", "type": "document", "fileType": "word", "size": "800KB", "description": "Company policies and guidelines.", "status": "Draft", "url": "#" }
]
For SharePoint/Google Drive: You can enter a "Source URL," but remember that a backend server is typically required to bypass browser security (CORS) for real-world cloud service integration.

LLM Integration: Optionally, enter your LLM API Endpoint and Key if you plan to integrate with an AI model for advanced features.

Click "Load & Save". Your documents should now appear!

How to Use
Browse: Click on folder cards to navigate into them.

Go Back: The breadcrumb trail at the top allows you to easily navigate back up the folder hierarchy.

Search: Type keywords into the search bar to filter documents and folders.

Favorite: Click the star icon on any card to toggle its favorite status. Favorited items appear in the "Favorites" filter in the sidebar.

Rename: Click on the title of a card to rename it. Your custom names will be saved locally.

Download: For document cards, click the "Download" button to initiate a download (if a url is provided in your data).

Technical Notes
Pure HTML/CSS/JS: This application is built entirely using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Local Storage: Configuration settings, favorited items, and custom names are persisted using localStorage in your browser.

CORS Warning: When attempting to fetch data from remote URLs (like SharePoint or Google Drive), you will likely encounter Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policy errors. This is a browser security feature. A server-side proxy or a dedicated backend API is needed to truly integrate with these services.

No Backend Needed for Local Files: If you're only using local JSON files, no server setup is required.

Future Enhancements (Ideas!)
Actual SharePoint/Google Drive API integration via a backend.

Real-time search filtering.

Document preview within the app.

Advanced LLM features like document summarization or Q&A.

More robust error handling and user feedback.

Enjoy managing your documents with DocuHub PRO!
